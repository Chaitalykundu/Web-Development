# Steps

1. **_Node.js Installation_**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system as it includes npm (Node Package Manager), which weâ€™ll use to manage dependencies.

2. **_Create React App_**: Use Create React App to set up a new React project quickly.

   - Run the following command in your terminal to create a new React application.

     > npx create-react-app my-react-app

   - Once the project is created, navigate to your project directory:

     > cd app_name

   - Start the development server to see your React application in action
     > npm start
