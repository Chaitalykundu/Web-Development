# Introduction

React is a Javascript library developed by **Facebook** to build interactive User Interfaces.

It follows the **Component-based architecture** which means you will divide your whole UI part into reusable components. All components are made separately and finally fitted into a parent component which is then rendered.

It is fast, flexible and it also has a strong community sitting online to help you every time.

# Features

- <u>***Component-Based Architecture***</u>: React follows **Component-based architecture**, which means we can divide your whole UI part into reusable components.

- <u>***Declarative Syntax***</u>: React’s approach focuses on describing how the UI should look based on its current state, leading to efficient updates and clear code readability.

- <u>***Virtual DOM***</u>: React uses a virtual DOM, an in-memory representation of the actual DOM, for efficient updates and minimal DOM manipulations, resulting in better performance.

- <u>***Unidirectional Data Flow***</u>: React follows a one-way data flow, ensuring that data flows down the component hierarchy via props. Any changes trigger re-renders, maintaining a predictable data flow pattern.

- <u>***Rich Ecosystem***</u>: React boasts a diverse ecosystem with numerous libraries, tools, and community contributions. This wealth of resources empowers developers to extend their applications with ease and add new features seamlessly.

# Some important topics to learn in ReactJS

- Component Architecture

- State: Basically ‘state’ holds synchronous variables. If you change the value of a state variable then the change is reflected immediately in all the places that particular variable is used.

- Props: are just like arguments passed in a function or method. In React props (arguments) are passed into an HTML tag as input arguments.

- Functional Components, Class Components.

- Styling(CSS) in React.

- Learn how to connect to APIs with React apps.
