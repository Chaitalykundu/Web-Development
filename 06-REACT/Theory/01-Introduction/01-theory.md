# Introduction

React is a **Javascript library** developed by **Facebook** to build interactive User Interfaces.

It follows the **Component-based architecture** which means you will divide your whole UI part into reusable components. All components are made separately and finally fitted into a parent component which is then rendered.

It is fast, flexible and it also has a strong community sitting online to help you every time.

# Features

- <u>**_Component-Based Architecture_**</u>: React follows **Component-based architecture**, which means we can divide your whole UI part into reusable components.

- <u>**_JSX_**</u>: JSX is a combination of HTML and JavaScript. Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup.

- <u>**_Declarative Syntax_**</u>: React’s approach focuses on describing how the UI should look based on its current state, leading to efficient updates and clear code readability.

- <u>**_Virtual DOM_**</u>: React uses virtual DOM which is an exact copy of real DOM. Whenever there is a modification in the web application, the whole virtual DOM is updated first and finds the difference between real DOM and Virtual DOM.

- <u>**_One way Data Flow_**</u>: React follows a one-way data flow, i.e. the data is transferred from top to bottom i.e. from parent component to child components via props. Any changes trigger re-renders, maintaining a predictable data flow pattern.

- <u>**_Performance_**</u>: As react uses virtual DOM and updates only the modified parts, this makes the DOM to run faster. DOM executes in memory so we can create separate components which makes the DOM run faster.

- <u>**_Extension_**</u>: React has many extensions that we can use to create full-fledged UI applications. It supports mobile app development and provides server-side rendering. React is extended with **_Flux, Redux, React Native_**, etc. which helps us to create good-looking UI.

- <u>**_Simplicity_**</u>: React is component-based which makes the code reusable and React uses JSX which is a combination of HTML and JavaScript. This makes code easy to understand and easy to debug and has less code.

- <u>**_Rich Ecosystem_**</u>: React boasts a diverse ecosystem with numerous libraries, tools, and community contributions. This wealth of resources empowers developers to extend their applications with ease and add new features seamlessly.

# Some important topics to learn in ReactJS

- Component Architecture

- State: Basically ‘state’ holds synchronous variables. If you change the value of a state variable then the change is reflected immediately in all the places that particular variable is used.

- Props: are just like arguments passed in a function or method. In React props (arguments) are passed into an HTML tag as input arguments.

- Functional Components, Class Components.

- Styling(CSS) in React.

- Learn how to connect to APIs with React apps.
