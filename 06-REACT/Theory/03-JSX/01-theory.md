# What is JSX?

- JSX stands for **_JavaScript XML_**.

- Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup.

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.

- JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

- JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information.

- JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

# Difference Between JSX and React

JSX and React are two separate things. JSX is a `syntax extension`, while React is a `JavaScript library`.

&nbsp;

# What is Fragment

JSX can return only one element. If we want to return multiple elements then we can use `<>` and `</>`. This empty tag is called a _**Fragment**_.

Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.
