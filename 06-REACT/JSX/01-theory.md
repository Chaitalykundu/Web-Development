# What is JSX?

- JSX stands for **_JavaScript XML_**.

- JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.

- JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

* JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

We can we <>...</> to return multiple elements.
