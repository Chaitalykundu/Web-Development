# Difference between npm and npx

| Parameters                | NPM                                                                                                                                            | NPX                                                                                                                                                                |

| Definition:               | NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine.                                              | NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.                                                        |
|Stands for |Node Package Manager|Node Package Execute |
| Installation of packages: | NPM installs packages globally, which means that your machine may be polluted by packages that are not required anymore in the long run.       | NPX does not install packages, so package pollution on the machine is not a concern.                                                                               |
| Application:              | To use create-react-app using NPM, we would first have to install it globally, and then run it, which makes using NPM in such cases redundant. | The most common application of NPX is the create-react-app command. Since we only need to use it once, i.e., while initializing the project, we do not install it. |
