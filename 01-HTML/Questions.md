# Answer

# Introduction

## 1. What is HTML

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup language.

It Provides a way of displaying the webpages with texts and images or other multimedia contents.

HTML is used to define the `layout` or the `structure` of a webpage.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2. What is Hypertext

Hypertext is a way of connecting texts or images or webpages to another one, either in a single website or between websites.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 3. What is markup language

Markup Language is the way to structure and format the contents of a webpage. To do this HTML use `tags` and `attributes`.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 4. How many types of pages are there in website

There are two types of pages in website.

1. Static page
2. Dynamic page

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 5. What is dynamic webpage

Dynamic webpages are those where the contents of the webpages depends on the user input.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 6. What is the purpose of a web browser

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Basic Structure

1. What will happen if we add `<!DOCTYPE>` at the end of our html page

The <`!DOCTYPE>` declaration is a signal to the browser to render the page in **standards mode** or **quirks mode**. If it’s placed later, the browser will assume no `<!DOCTYPE>` was provided and may default to quirks mode.

Always place `<!DOCTYPE>` at the very beginning of your HTML document to ensure proper **standards-compliant rendering** by the browser.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Image

## 7. When is alt attribute more useful

```md
1 - Slow internet connection:

When a user has a slow internet connection, images may take a longer time to load, or they may not load at all due to the connection's limitations. In such cases, the alt attribute provides an immediate text-based representation of the image's content, allowing the user to understand the context even before the image loads.

2 - No image shown due to any reason:

This includes situations where images fail to load for various reasons, not just slow internet connections. Images may not load due to broken links, browser settings, content filtering, or other issues. In such cases, the alt attribute acts as a fallback, ensuring that users still receive information about the image's content even if the image itself cannot be displayed. The alt attribute is an important accessibility feature that provides text alternatives to images, making web content more inclusive and usable for all users, regardless of their internet connection speed or other potential issues affecting image loading.
```

# Input
