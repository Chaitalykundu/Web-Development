# LCP

LCP = Largest Contentful Paint

The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport, relative to when the page first started loading.

&nbsp;

To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have Largest Contentful Paint of **2.5 seconds or less**. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the **75th percentile** of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

# FID

FID = First Input Delay

FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (that is, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.

&nbsp;

To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First Input Delay of **100 milliseconds or less**. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the **75th percentile** of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.
