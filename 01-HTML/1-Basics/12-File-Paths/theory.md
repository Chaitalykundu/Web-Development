# File path / URL

- URL = Uniform Resource Locator

- A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

- File paths are used when linking to external files, like:

  - Web pages
  - Images
  - Style sheets
  - JavaScripts
  - Favicon

# Types of File Paths

There are **two** types of File Paths

- Absolute File Paths
- Relative File Paths

&nbsp;

# Absolute File Paths

- An absolute file path specify the **complete location** of a file in a system, starting from the root directory.

- It contains the entire address from the protocol (HTTPS) to the domain name (`www.example.com`) and includes the location within your website in your folder system (`/foldernameA or /foldernameB`) names within the URL.

&nbsp;

## Example

```html
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" />
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Relative File Paths

- A relative file path refers to the location of a file relative to the current web pageâ€™s location.

&nbsp;

## Example

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the `images` folder located at the root of the current web.

```html
<img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" />
```

| Path                              | Description                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<img src="picture.jpg">`         | The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page              |
| `<img src="images/picture.jpg">`  | The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder          |
| `<img src="/images/picture.jpg">` | The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web |
| `<img src="../picture.jpg">`      | The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder  |
|                                   |                                                                                       |
