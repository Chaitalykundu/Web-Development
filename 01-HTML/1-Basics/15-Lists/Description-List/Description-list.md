# HTML Description List or Definition List

- A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.

- This is supported by HTML and XHTML.

- The HTML definition list contains following three tags:

  - The `<dl>` tag defines the description list,
  - the `<dt>` tag defines the term (name)
  - the `<dd>` tag describes each term

&nbsp;

- Example

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
  <dd>- Healthy</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
  <dd>- Healthy</dd>
</dl>

- It is also known as definition list where entries are listed like a dictionary or encyclopedia.
