# Similarities between HTML and CSS

- <u>Syntax</u>: Both HTML and CSS use a similar syntax, with the use of tags and selectors to define elements on a webpage.

- <u>Separation of Concerns</u>: Both HTML and CSS follow the principle of separation of concerns, where HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage, while CSS defines the style and layout.

- <u>Cascading</u>: The “C” in CSS stands for “Cascading”, which means that styles can be inherited and overridden based on the order of the style rules and the specificity of the selectors.

- <u>Integration</u>: HTML and CSS are often used together, with CSS being used to style the elements defined in HTML.

# Differences between HTML & CSS
