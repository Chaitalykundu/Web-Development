# Markup Language

A Markup Language is a way to structure and format the content of a webpage. To do this HTML uses two things: `tags` and `attributes`.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Types of pages

There are **_two_** types of pages.

1. Static pages
2. Dynamic pages

&nbsp;

- <u>**_Static pages_**</u>: It contains static contents (text or images)

- <u>**_Dynamic pages_**</u> : Dynamic pages are those where the content of the webpages depends on user input. So interaction with the user is required in order to display the web page.

# Note

- HTML documents are saved with `.html` or `.htm` file extensions.

- **_HTML tags are enclosed in angled brackets_** (< >) to define the structure and content of web pages. They can also contain attributes or additional information about the tag.

- **_HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page_**. These are defined by a start tag, content, and end tag.

- **_HTML attributes are extra bits of information_** that you can add to HTML elements to modify behavior or provide additional information.

# HTML document in Browser

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags but uses them to determine how to display the document.

Open the file saved with the `.html` extension, and automatically it will open in the browser and all the content written inside the `<body>` tag will be displayed in the browser.
