# N.B:

- HTML documents are saved with .html or .htm file extensions.

- ***HTML tags are enclosed in angled brackets*** (< >) to define the structure and content of web pages. They can also contain attributes or additional information about the tag.

- ***HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page***. These are defined by a start tag, content, and end tag, with common examples being paragraph `<p>` tags and more complex elements like images and videos via `<img>` and `<video>` tags.

- ***HTML attributes are extra bits of information*** that you can add to HTML elements to modify behavior or provide additional information.
