# Key Features of HTML

- **_HTML documents_** are saved with .html or .htm file extensions.

- **_HTML is closely related to other web technologies_** like CSS and JavaScript, with CSS styling and formatting HTML content and JavaScript adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

- **_HTML tags are defined by angled brackets_** (< >) to define the structure and content of web pages. They can also contain attributes or additional information about the tag.

- **_HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page_**. These are defined by a start tag, content, and end tag, with common examples being paragraph `<p>` tags and more complex elements like images and videos via `<img>` and `<video>` tags.

- **_HTML attributes are extra bits of information_** that you can add to HTML elements to modify behavior or provide additional information.

- **_HTML is platform-independent_**, means you can use it on any device or operating system, and popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge can render content.

- **_HTML nesting_** allows one HTML element to be placed inside another, creating a hierarchical element structure ideal for grouping related content and providing additional structure.

- **_HTML has built-in accessibility features_** to ensure web content is accessible to all users, including support for screen readers, magnifiers, and text descriptions for images and media.

- **_HTML uses semantic markup elements_** to add meaning and structure to web content, with common examples of semantic tags being `<header>` and `<footer>`. This can also be useful for SEO, allowing search engines to understand web page structure better.
