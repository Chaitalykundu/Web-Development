# Why do we use HTML Form

HTML forms are required if you want to collect some datas from the site visitor.

For example: If a user want to purchase some items on internet, he/she must fill the form such as shipping address and credit/debit card details so that item can be sent to the given address.

# Syntax

<form action="server url" method="get|post">
  //input controls e.g. textfield, textarea, radiobutton, button
</form>
```
