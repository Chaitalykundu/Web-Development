# target Attribute

Using target attribute, we can define **where the linked document will be opened**.

&nbsp;

The target attribute has the following values:

- `_self` : load the URL into the **current tab** itself. This is the default.

- `_blank` : load the URL into a **new tab** or browser window.

- `_parent` : load the URL into the **parent browsing context**. If there is no parent, this behaves the same as \_self.

- `_top` : load the URL into the **top-level browsing context**. If there is no parent, this behaves the same as \_self
