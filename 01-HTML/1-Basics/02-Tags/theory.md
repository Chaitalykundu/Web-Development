# Tags

- Tags are like keywords, which define how browsers will format and display the contents.

- Tags have pre-defined meanings to the browsers.

- Every tag in HTML performs different tasks.

- HTML Tags are always written in lowercase letters. Though HTML is Not Case Sensitive. `<p>` and `<P>` are same

- They are usually enclosed in angle brackets `<` & `>`

- Tags with an opening and closing can have any number of tags within themselves. This means nested tags are also supported.

# Types of tags

There are **two** types of tags in HTML

1. Container tag
2. Empty Tag

## <u>Container tag : </u>

- An HTML tag is known as a container tag when the tag consists of an opening tag and a closing tag as its companion tag.

- Example : `<u>` and `</u>` will **underline** text.

- You must include the slash ( / ) in the closing tag in order to the pair to work.

- This is also called **Paired tag**

## <u>Empty tag : </u>

- An HTML tag is called an empty tag when the tag only has an opening tag and does not have a closing tag or a companion tag.
