- Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

* A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

* Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.

* Examples of semantic elements:` <form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.

* Semantic elements do not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style these elements
