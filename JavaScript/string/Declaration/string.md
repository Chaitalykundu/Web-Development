# Template Literal

- Template Literal use backtick in stead of quote to define a string

* Example :

```js
let name = `Chaitaly`;
let sentence = `You are a student`;
```

- We can insert variable directly inside the Template Literal. This is called string interpolation

* Example :

```js
let a = `This is ${name}`;
```
