# Definition and Usage

An `outline` is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out".

&nbsp;

# Note

Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content.

Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

&nbsp;

CSS has the following outline properties:

- outline
- outline-width
- outline-style
- outline-color
- outline-offset
