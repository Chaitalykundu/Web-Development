# Definition and Usage

- The `:first-of-type` selector matches every element that is the first child, of a particular type, of its parent.

&nbsp;

# Tip

This is the same as `:nth-of-type(1)`.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# CSS Syntax

```css
:first-of-child {
  css declarations;
}
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Example

Specify a background color for the first `<p>` element of its parent:

```css
p:first-of-type {
  background: red;
}
```
