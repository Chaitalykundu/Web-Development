In HTML, there are **two** main types of lists:

- unordered lists `(<ul>)` - the list items are marked with **bullets**

- ordered lists `(<ol>)` - the list items are marked with **numbers or letters**

&nbsp;

The CSS list properties allow you to:

- Set the **distance between the text and the marker** in the list.

- Specify **an image for the marker** instead of using the number or bullet point.
- **Control the marker** appearance and shape.
- Place the marker outside or inside the box that contains the list items.
- Set the **background colors** to list items and lists.
