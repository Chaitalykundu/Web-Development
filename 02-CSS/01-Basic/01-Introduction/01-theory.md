# Why use CSS

## 1. Solves a big problem

Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.

## 2. Saves a lot of time

CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.

## 3. Provide more attributes

CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website
