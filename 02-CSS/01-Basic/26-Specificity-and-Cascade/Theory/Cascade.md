# What is Cascade

The Cascade is an algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to a HTML element.

&nbsp;

The cascade algorithm has four distinct stages

1. **_Position and order of appearance_** : The order in which CSS rules appear

2. **_Specificity_** : an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match

3. **_Origin_** : the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from.

4. **_Importance_** : Some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the `!important` rule type.
