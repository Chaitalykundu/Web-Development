- The color property in CSS is used to set the color of HTML elements.

* Typically, this property is used to set the **background color** or the **font color** of an element.

In CSS, we use color values for specifying the color. We can also use this property for the **border-color** and other decorative effects.

&nbsp;

We can define the color of an element by using the following ways:

- Built-in color.
- RGB format.
- RGBA format.
- HEX value or Hexadecimal notation.
- HSL.
- HSLA.
