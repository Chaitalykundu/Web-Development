# Overview

The CSS **background** properties are used to add **_background effects_** for elements.

&nbsp;

CSS background properties are:

- background (shorthand property)
- background-color
- background-image
- background-position
- background-size
- background-repeat
- background-origin
- background-clip
- background-attachment
- background-break

&nbsp;

# Note

The background of an element is the _total size of the element_, including padding and border (but not the margin) because as per the definition, padding is the inner space contained in the content, but the margin is the outer empty area from the content.
