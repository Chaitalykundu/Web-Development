Typography is the visual component of the written word.

Typography includes the CSS properties that allow you to define the **color, size, spacing, and shape** of text.

Typography is all about **style**, **proportions**, and **spacing**.

# Typography vs Lettering

Typography is actually a subset of lettering, because it is the study of letters applied to typefaces. Many designers have also taken up letterpress printing as a hobby or side interest, which also utilizes aspects of typography or typesetting, depending on the project.

Typography is essentially the study of how letterforms interact on a surface, directly relating to how the type will be set when it eventually goes to press
