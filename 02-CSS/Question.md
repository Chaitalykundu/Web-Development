No. Inline element ignores height and width. It only takes the width as much as needed
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 1. What is cascade

```md
The cascade is the `algorithm` for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 2. What is Margin Collapse

```md
**Top** and **bottom** margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 3. What are the hover feature

```md
Change the color of the background and font.
Modify the opacity of the image.
Text embedding.
Create image rollover effects.
Swapping of images.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 4. What is the difference between PX, EM and Percent?

```md
Pixel is a static measurement, while percent and EM are relative measurements. Percent depends on its parent font size. EM is relative to the current font size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font). So, If the font size of body is 16 pixels, then 150% will be 24 pixels (1.5 _ 16), and 2em will be 32 pixels (16 _ 2).
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 5. What are Web Safe Fonts?

```md
Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.

The following list are the best web safe fonts for HTML and CSS:

    Arial (sans-serif)
    Verdana (sans-serif)
    Tahoma (sans-serif)
    Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)
    Times New Roman (serif)
    Georgia (serif)
    Garamond (serif)
    Courier New (monospace)
    Brush Script MT (cursive)
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 6. what is scroll anchoring

```md
Scroll anchoring is a feature in the browser that prevents a viewable area that is scrolled into focus to move when new content is loaded above. This is typically a problem on a slow connection if the user scrolls down and starts reading before the page is fully loaded.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 7. What is VH/VW (viewport height/ viewport width) in CSS?

```md
It’s a CSS unit used to measure the height and width in percentage with respect to the viewport. It is used mainly in responsive design techniques. The measure VH is equal to 1/100 of the height of the viewport. If the height of the browser is 1000px, 1vh is equal to 10px. Similarly, if the width is 1000px, then 1 vw is equal to 10px.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 8. Difference between margin and padding?

| Margin                                                                       | Padding                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The outer space of an element, i.e. margin, is the space outside the border. | The inner space of an element, i.e.padding is space inside the element’s border. |
| It can be negative or any float number.                                      | It does not allow negative values                                                |
| We can set the margin to auto.                                               | We cannot set the padding to auto.                                               |
| Styling of an element such as background color does not affect the margin.   | Padding is affected by the styling of an element, such as background color.      |

# What are the different Box Sizing Properties?

The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element are calculated.

- `Content-box`: The default width and height values applyto the element's content only. The padding and border are added to the outside of the box.

- `Padding-box`: Width and height values apply to the element's content and its padding. The border is added to the outside of the box. Currently, only Firefox supports the padding-box value.

- `Border-box`: Width and height values apply to the content,padding and border
