# Introdunction

Tailwind CSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework designed to make it easy to build modern, responsive, and customizable user interfaces.

Instead of writing custom CSS for styling, Tailwind provides a set of utility classes that can be directly applied to your HTML elements. These classes help you control various aspects of design, such as layout, spacing, typography, colors, and more.
