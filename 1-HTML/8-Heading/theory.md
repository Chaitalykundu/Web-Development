# Heading

- HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.

* `<h1>` defines the most important heading.

* `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

* Heading elements (h1....h6) should be used for headings only. They should not be used just to make text bold or big.

* HTML headings can also be used with nested elements.

# Headings Are Important

Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

`<h1>` headings should be used for main headings, followed by` <h2>` headings, then the less important `<h3>`, and so on.

# Bigger Headings

- Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:

* Example :

```html
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
```
