# Types of tags

We have divided HTML tags based on the following classifications:

1.  Paired Tags and Unpaired Tags
2.  Self-Closing Tags
3.  Utility-Based Tags.

&nbsp;

## <u>Paired Tags and Unpaired Tags</u>

### **_Paired tag_** :

- An HTML tag is known as a paired tag when the tag consists of an opening tag and a closing tag as its companion tag.

- For example, `<u>` and `</u>` will underline text.

* You must include the slash ( / ) in the closing tag in order for the pair to work.

### **_Unpaired tag_** :

- An HTML tag is called an unpaired tag when the tag only has an opening tag and does not have a closing tag or a companion tag.

- For example, `<hr>`

&nbsp;

## <u>Self-Closing Tags</u>

- Self-Closing Tags are those HTML tags that do not have a partner tag, where the first tag is the only necessary tag that is valid for the formatting.

* The main and important information is contained WITHIN the element as its attribute.

* For example : `<img src="a.jpg" alt="This is an alternate text">`

&nbsp;

## <u>Utility-Based Tags</u>

- We can divide them basically into three categories as discussed below:

### 1. Formatting Tags

- The HTML tags that help us in the formatting of the texts like the size of the text, font styles, making a text bold, etc.

* This is done using tags like `<font>, <b>, <u>, <table>, <div>` etc.

### 2. Structure Tags

- The HTML tags that help in structuring the HTML document are called Structure Tags.
- Ex : Description, head, html, title, body, etc.,

### 3. Control Tags

- These are the tags that are used in managing content or managing scripts or libraries that are external.
