NodeJS is an execution environment for javascript.

It’s not a programming language

Node allows you to do all operations outside the browser.

NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM is a package manager to install node modules and packages to your project just like PIP for python.

Import: Once you will install the Node module using NPM in your project you will have to use the ‘import’ keyword to use that module.

Export: Use this keyword when you are creating a module/component and you have to return only a part, not all the methods and variables.
