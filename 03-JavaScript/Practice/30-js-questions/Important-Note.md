# Note

1. In JS, you don't need to explicitly specify the type of a variable during declaration. The type is inferred based on the kind of value assigned to the variable.

   ```md
   For example if you put decimal values in a variable, the type of variable becomes float.

   const pi = 3.14;
   ```
