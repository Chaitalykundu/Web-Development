# Introduction

DOM = Document Object Model

`Document Object Model (DOM)` is a programming interface or JS representation for HTML and XML documents, that allows to create, manipulate, or delete the element from the document. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

&nbsp;

`HTML` is used to structure the web pages and `Javascript` is used to add behavior to our web pages.

When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the javascript can not understand the HTML document directly. So, a corresponding document tree is created(DOM).

&nbsp;

***DOM tree refers to a HTML page where all the nodes are objects.***

There can be 3 main types of nodes in the DOM tree:
* text nodes
* element nodes
* comment nodes

&nbsp;

DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

In HTML page `html` is the root node and `head` and `body` are its children.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

- JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page

- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page

- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page

- JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
- JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

# What is the DOM?

The DOM is a **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)** standard.

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

    "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

&nbsp;

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

- **Core DOM** - standard model for all document types
- **XML DOM** - standard model for XML documents
- **HTML DOM** - standard model for HTML documents

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# What is the HTML DOM?

The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. 

It defines:

- The HTML elements as objects

- The properties of all HTML elements
- The methods to access all HTML elements
- The events for all HTML elements

&nbsp;

In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to **get**, **change**, **add**, or **delete** HTML elements.
