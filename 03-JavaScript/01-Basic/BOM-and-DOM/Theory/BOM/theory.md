BOM = Browser Object Model

The function `alert`, `prompt` and `confirm` are also the part of BOM.

The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser.

# The Window Object

The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.

All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
