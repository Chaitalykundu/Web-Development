# The script tag

The `script tag` is used to **insert javascript into an HTML page.**

The script tag can be used to insert external and internal scripts.

&nbsp;

## Internal javascript code

```js
<script>alert("Hello")</script>
```

&nbsp;

## External javascript code

```js
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

&nbsp;

The benefit of separate javascript file is that the browser can download it and store it in its cache. It also makes the code readable.
