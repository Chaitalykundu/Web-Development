# Conditional statements

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Sometimes we need to execute block of code based on some condition. At that time condition statement is used.

If the condition is true then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of action that satisfies that particular condition.

&nbsp;

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use `if`, if we need to check only one condition
- Use `else`, if we need to check two conditions
- Use `else if`, if we need to check more than two conditions
- Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
