JavaScript comments can be used to

- explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
- prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

&nbsp;

# Single Line Comments

Single line comments start with `//`.

&nbsp;

## Example

```js
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
```

&nbsp;

This example uses a single line comment at the end of each line to explain the code:

```js
let x = 5; // Declare x, give it the value of 5
let y = x + 2; // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with /\* and end with \*/.

&nbsp;

# Example

```js
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
```
