The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

- Fixed values
- Variable values

Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Literals

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:

   ```js
   10.5;
   1001;
   ```

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
   ```js
   "John Doe";
   `'John Doe';`;
   ```

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Variables

variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to declare variables.

An **equal** sign is used to assign values to variables.

```js
let x;
x = 6;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Operators

JavaScript uses **arithmetic operators** ( + - \* / ) to compute values and **assignment operator** ( = ) to assign values to variables:

```js
x = (5 + 6) * 10;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.

The `let` keyword tells the browser to create variables:

```js
let x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x \* 10;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Comments

Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes // or between /\* and \*/ is treated as a comment.
