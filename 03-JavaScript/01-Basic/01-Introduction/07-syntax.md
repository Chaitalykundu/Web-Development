# JavaScript Values

The JavaScript syntax defines **two** types of values:

- Fixed values
- Variable values

Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

&nbsp;

# Note

JavaScript is **Case Sensitive**

**Hyphens** are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Literals

The two most important syntax rules for Literals are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:

   ```js
   10.5;
   1001;
   ```

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

   ```js
   "John Doe";
   `'John Doe';`;
   ```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Variables

Variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to declare variables.

An **equal** sign is used to assign values to variables.

```js
let x;
x = 6;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Operators

JavaScript uses **arithmetic operators** ( + - \* / ) to compute values and **assignment operator** ( = ) to assign values to variables:

```js
x = (5 + 6) * 10;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Expressions

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an **evaluation**.

```js
res = 5 * 10;
```

&nbsp;

The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JavaScript Identifiers / Names

Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

&nbsp;

## Rules for Identifiers

- A JavaScript name must begin with:

  - A letter (A-Z or a-z)
  - A dollar sign ($)
  - Or an underscore (\_)

- Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

&nbsp;

## Note

Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.
