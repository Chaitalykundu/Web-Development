# Programming

Programming is a way to talk to computers.

# ECMAScript

ES stands for ECMAScript.

ECMA defines specifications of scripting language.

ECMAScript (/ˈɛkməskrɪpt/; ES) is a specification or standard that tells how scripting language should be.

The **ECMAScript** specification is a blueprint for creating a scripting language.
**JavaScript** is an implementation of that blueprint.

It was created to ensure that different documents on javascript are talking about the same language

# Javascript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, event-based, client-side, object-oriented programming language.

JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages.

This is a scripting language for web pages.

&nbsp;

JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.

# Features of JavaScript

<img src="../assets/features-of-js.png" height=300px>

&nbsp;

- **_Scripting_** : Javascript executes the client-side script in the browser.

- **_Interpreter_** : The browser interprets JavaScript code.

- **_Event Handling_** : Events are actions. Javascript provides event-handling options.

- **_Light Weight_** : As Javascript is not a compiled language, source code never changes to byte code before running time. Low-end devices can also run Javascript because of its lightweight feature.

- **_Case Sensitive_** : In Javascript, names, variables, keywords, and functions are case-sensitive.

- **_Control Statements_** : Javascript has control statements like if-else-if, switch case, and loop. Users can write complex code using these control statements.

* **_Objects as first-class Citizens_** : Javascript arrays, functions, and symbols are objects which can inherit the Object prototype properties. Objects being first-class citizens means Objects can do all tasks.

* **_Supports Functional Programming_** : Javascript functions can be an argument to another function, can call by reference, and can assign to a variable.

* **_Dynamic Typing_** : Javascript variables can have any value type. The same variable can have a string value, an integer value, or any other.

* **_Client-side Validations_** : Javascript client-side validations allow users to submit valid data to the server during a form submission.

* **_Platform Independent_** : Javascript will run in the same way in all systems with any operating system.

# Application of JavaScript

JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:

- modifying an HTML page dynamically.
- validating user input
- create cookies
- Displaying date and time,
- Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
- Displaying clocks etc.
- Javascript user interaction does not require any communication with the server

- Web-server
- Game Development
- 3-D drawing
- Mobile apps
- Smart watch apps
