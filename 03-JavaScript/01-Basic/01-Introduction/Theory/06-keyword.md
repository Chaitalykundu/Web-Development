# JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript keywords are the **reserved words** whose meanings are already pre-defined and are used to identify actions to be performed.

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword.

Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.

# Example

The `let` keyword tells the browser to create variables

```js
let x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;
```
