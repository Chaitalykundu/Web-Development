# Statements

A computer program is a list of "**instructions**" to be "**executed**" by a computer. In a programming language, these programming instructions are called **_statements_**.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

&nbsp;

JavaScript statements are composed of:

- Values
- Operators
- Expressions
- Keywords
- Comments.

&nbsp;

## Example

```js
let x, y, z; // Statement 1
x = 5; // Statement 2
y = 6; // Statement 3
z = x + y; // Statement 4
```

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

# JavaScript White Space

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:

```js
let person = "Hege";
let person = "Hege";
```

A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - \* / )

# JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator

## Example

```js
`document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 
"Hello Dolly!";`;
```
