# JavaScript vs Java

| Topic                         | JavaScript                                                                                            | Java                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic Difference              | A lightweight, interpreted scripting language primarily used for web development.                     | A compiled, object-oriented programming language used for building standalone applications, web applications, and enterprise software. |
| Execution Environment         | Runs in web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and can also run on servers using Node.js                | Runs in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and requires compilation into bytecode before execution.                                        |
| Typing System                 | Dynamically typed (variables can hold any data type).                                                 | Statically typed (variables must have a specific data type).                                                                           |
| Compilation vs Interpretation | Interpreted language (executed line by line).                                                         | Compiled language (converted to bytecode and executed by JVM).                                                                         |
| Object-Oriented Approach      | Prototype-based object orientation.                                                                   | Class-based object orientation                                                                                                         |
| Concurrency Model             | Single-threaded, event-driven (asynchronous with event loop and Promises)                             | Multi-threaded (supports parallel execution with threads).                                                                             |
| Use Cases                     | Used for front-end development, dynamic web pages, backend (Node.js), and mobile apps (React Native). | Used for enterprise applications, Android apps, backend development (Spring, Hibernate), and large-scale systems.                      |
| Security                      | Runs in a sandboxed environment inside the browser.                                                   | Runs in a secure JVM environment but has more system access.                                                                           |
| Memory Management             | Automatic garbage collection but less efficient than Java.                                            | More advanced garbage collection mechanisms.                                                                                           |
|                               |                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                        |

# Syntax Similarities

Both languages use C-style syntax with {} for code blocks, if conditions, loops, and function definitions.
