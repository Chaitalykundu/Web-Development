Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false.

Comparison or Relational operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

## Example :

```js
if (age < 18) text = "Too young to buy alcohol";
```

| Operator | Description                        | Example         |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| ==       | Is equal to                        | 10==20 = false  |
| ===      | Identical (equal and of same type) | 10==20 = false  |
| !=       | Not equal to                       | 10!=20 = true   |
| !==      | Not Identical                      | 20!==20 = false |
| >        | Greater than                       | 20>10 = true    |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to           | 20>=10 = true   |
| <        | Less than                          | 20<10 = false   |
| <=       | Less than or equal to              | 20<=10 = false  |
