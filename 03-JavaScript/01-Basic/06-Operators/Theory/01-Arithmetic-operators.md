# Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on numbers.

&nbsp;

# Example

```js
let a = 3;
let x = (100 + 50) * a;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

| Operator | Description         | Example                   |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| +        | Addition            | 10+20 = 30                |
| -        | Subtraction         | 20-10 = 10                |
| \*       | Multiplication      | 10\*20 = 200              |
| /        | Division            | 20/10 = 2                 |
| %        | Modulus (Remainder) | 20%3 = 2                  |
| \*\*     | Exponentiation      | 2 \*\* 3 = 8              |
| ++       | Increment           | var a=10; a++; Now a = 11 |
| --       | Decrement           | var a=10; a--; Now a = 9  |
|          |                     |                           |

# Operators and Operands

The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called **operands**.

The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Adding

The addition operator (+) adds numbers:

## Example

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Subtracting

The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers.

## Example

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x - y;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Multiplying

The multiplication operator (\*) multiplies numbers.

## Example

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Dividing

The division operator (/) divides numbers.

## Example

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x / y;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Remainder

The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder.

## Example

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x % y;
```

In arithmetic, the division of two integers produces a quotient and a remainder.

In mathematics, the result of a modulo operation is the remainder of an arithmetic division.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Exponentiation

The exponentiation operator (\*\*) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

## Example

```js
let x = 5;
let z = x ** 2;
```

x \*\* y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y):

## Example

```js
let x = 5;
let z = Math.pow(x, 2);
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Incrementing

The increment operator (++) increments numbers.

## Example

```js
let x = 5;
x++;
let z = x;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Decrementing

The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.

## Example

```js
let x = 5;
x--;
let z = x;
```
