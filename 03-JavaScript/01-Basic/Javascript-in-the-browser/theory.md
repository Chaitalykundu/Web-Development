# Overview

HTML = Skeleton

CSS = Styling

JavaScript = Logic

JavaScript is not understandable by computer but the only browser understands JavaScript. So, we need a program to convert our JavaScript program into computer-understandable language.

Browser has an embedded engine called **JavaScript engine** or the **JavaScript Runtime** for this.

# JavaScript Engine

A `JavaScript engine` is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language.
