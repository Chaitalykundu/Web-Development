JavaScript strings are for storing and manipulating text.

A JavaScript string is **zero or more characters** written inside single or double quotes.

&nbsp;

## Example

```
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes
```

&nbsp;

You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

## Example

```js
let answer1 = "It's alright";
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';
```

&nbsp;

# Template Literal

Template Literal use backtick in stead of quote to define a string

## Example :

```js
let name = `Chaitaly`;
let sentence = `You are a student`;
```

&nbsp;

We can insert variable directly inside the Template Literal. This is called **string interpolation**

## Example :

```js
let a = `This is ${name}`;
```
