# Definition

A function is a block of codes designed to perform a particular task.

It is reusable.

# Why do we use functions

1. **Code Reusability :** Functions allow us to define a block of code that can be used multiple times.

2. **Abstraction & Encapsulation :** Functions help abstract away complex operations by providing a higher level interface. They also allow us to encapsulate a series of instructions into a single unit making our code more organization and easier to understand.

3. **Modularity :** Functions enable us to break down a large problem into smaller, manageable tasks.

4. **Code organization**

5. **Readability & Maintainability**

6. **Parameterization & flexibility**

7. **Function Composition :** Functions can be composed meaning they can be combined to create a new functions that perform complex operations.

# Modularity

Modularity refers to the practice of breaking down a system or program into separate, self-contained modules or components.
