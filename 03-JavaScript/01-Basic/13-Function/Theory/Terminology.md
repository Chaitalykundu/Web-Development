# Modularity

Modularity refers to the practice of breaking down a system or program into separate, self-contained modules or components.

&nbsp;

# Parameterization

Parameterization is the process of defining parameters in a function to make it more flexible and reusable by allowing different inputs.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# fallback value

A fallback value is a default value used when no valid or meaningful value is provided or available. It ensures that an application, function, or system continues to work even if an expected input is missing or invalid.
