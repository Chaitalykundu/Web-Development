# What are some best practices for optimizing a `for` loop in JavaScript?

### 1. Minimize Work Inside the Loop

**<u>Bad Example (Unnecessary Function Call)</u>**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < expensiveFunction(); i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

`expensiveFunction()` is called on every iteration, which is inefficient.

&nbsp;

**<u>Optimized Example</u>**

```js
let limit = expensiveFunction(); // Store result once
for (let i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

The function is called once before the loop starts.

&nbsp;

### 2. Cache array.length in a Variable

**<u>Bad Example (Recalculating Length)</u>**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

&nbsp;

**<u>Optimized Example</u>**

```js
let len = arr.length; // Cache array length
for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

&nbsp;

### 3. Use for...of for Iterating Over Arrays

If you only need values, prefer for...of, as itâ€™s more readable and optimized for arrays.

```js
let numbers = [10, 20, 30];

for (let num of numbers) {
  console.log(num);
}
```

&nbsp;

### 4. Avoid Using break and continue Unnecessarily

**<u>Bad Example (Unnecessary continue)</u>**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

&nbsp;

**<u>Optimized Example</u>**

```js
for (let i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

&nbsp;

### 5. Use map(), forEach(), or reduce() When Possible

```js
arr.forEach((item) => console.log(item));
```

```js
let doubled = arr.map((num) => num * 2);
```

&nbsp;

### 6. Avoid Unnecessary Variable Reassignments

**<u>Bad Example</u>**

```js
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  sum = sum + arr[i];
}
```

**<u>Optimized Example</u>**

```js
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0, len = arr.length; i < len; i++) {
  sum += arr[i]; // Uses shorthand operator
}
```
