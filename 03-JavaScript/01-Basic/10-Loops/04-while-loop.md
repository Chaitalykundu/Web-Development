The `while loop` loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

The purpose of a `while loop` is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as an expression is true.

Once the expression becomes false, the loop terminates.

# Syntax

```js
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

&nbsp;

# Example

```js
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
```

If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.
