The `continue` statement "**jumps over**" one iteration in the loop.

&nbsp;

The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

# Example

This example skips the value of 3:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue;
  }
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>"; // 0 1 2 4
}
```
