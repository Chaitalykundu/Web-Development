# Answer

# Introduction

## 1. What is Programming

Programming is the way of talking to computer

&nbsp;

## 2. What does ES stand for

ES stands for EcmaScript

&nbsp;

## 3. What is ECMAScript

Ecmascript defines the specification of scripting language.
Ecmascript is the specification or standard that tells how scripting language should be.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 5. How is it related to JavaScript

- JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript.

- ECMAScript provides the core features (such as data types, objects, functions, and control structures), while JavaScript adds browser-specific functionalities like DOM manipulation, events, and APIs.

- Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint, and JavaScript as a practical implementation based on that blueprint.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# JS Versions

## 1. When and by whom was javascript invented

JavaScript was invented by **Brendan Eich** in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2. What are the different names of javascript

Mocha > livescript > JavaScript

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 3. Why was JavaScript originally created?

JavaScript was originally created To add interactivity to web pages, like handling button clicks, form validation, and dynamic content updates.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 4. Which is the latest version of ECMAscript and what features were introduced there

As of February 2025, the latest version of ECMAScript (ES), the standard upon which JavaScript is based, is ECMAScript 2024 (ES15), published in June 2024.

&nbsp;

**Key Features Introduced in ECMAScript 2024:**

1. Grouping Synchronous Iterables: Object.groupBy() and Map.groupBy() Methods
2. Promise.withResolvers() Method
3. Regular Expression /v Flag
4. Resizable ArrayBuffers
5. Well-Formed Unicode Strings

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 5. What can we use in code to treat all js code as newer version?

`use strict`

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 6. What are the major differences between ES5 and ES6?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 7. What will happen if you run JavaScript code in an older browser that doesn’t support ES6 features?

If you try to run ES6 JavaScript in an older browser (like Internet Explorer or early versions of Chrome/Firefox), you may face errors or unexpected behavior because the browser doesn’t recognize ES6 syntax.

&nbsp;

| ES6 Feature                         | Issue in Older Browsers                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `let` and `const`                   | SyntaxError: `Unexpected identifier`      |
| Arrow Functions (()=>{})            | SyntaxError: `Unexpected token '=>'`      |
| Template Literals (`Hello ${name}`) | Displays raw string without variables     |
| Destructuring (const {name} = obj;) | SyntaxError: `Unexpected token {`         |
| import/export Modules               | SyntaxError: `Unexpected token 'import'`  |
| Promise and async/await             | ReferenceError: `Promise is not defined ` |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 8. Which JavaScript version is most commonly used today?

The most widely used JavaScript version today is ECMAScript 6 (ES6 / ES2015) and its subsequent updates (ES7 to ES2024).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 9. Why is ES6 the Most Popular?

- Widely Supported → All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) fully support ES6.
- Modern Features → Includes let/const, arrow functions, promises, template literals, and modules.
- Backward Compatibility → Works alongside ES5, ensuring a smooth transition.
- Node.js Compatibility → ES6+ is fully supported in modern Node.js versions, making it popular for backend -development too.
- Industry Adoption → Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue rely on ES6+ features

# How to add

## 1. Which tag is used to add JS code

The tag is used to add JS code `<script></script>`

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2. What are the places we can add JS code

We can add JS code in 3 places of HTML code

- Between the body tag of html
- Between the head tag of html
- In .js file (external javaScript)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 3. What are the advantages External JavaScript

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Output

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Datatype

## 2. Is null an independent type or object

```md
null is an object type
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Variable

### 8. Can we declare Many Variables is one statement

```md
Yes. By using comma.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Closure

### 1. What is a closure in JavaScript?

```md
A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer function's variables and parameters.

It allows the inner function to access and manipulate the outer function's variables, even after the outer function has returned.
```

&nbsp;

### 2. Why are closures important in JavaScript?

```md
Closures are important in JavaScript because they allow for information hiding and encapsulation. They also allow for private variables and methods, which can be useful in certain scenarios.
```

&nbsp;

### 3. Can you give an example of a closure in JavaScript?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

# 1. What are the Difference Between String `indexOf()` and String `search()`

```md
The `indexOf()` method cannot search against a regular expression.

The `search()` cannot take a start position argument.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 2.Why do we use functions?

```md
With functions you can reuse code

You can write code that can be used many times.

You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 3. What are the ways to empty an array?

1. Assigning to it in a new empty array :

   ```js
   let a = [1, 2, 3];
   console.log(b); // [1,2,3]

   let b = [];
   b = a;
   console.log(b); // []
   ```

   when the value `a` is assigned to an empty array `b`, the array `a` will also be empty. This is the fastest way to empty an aray.

2. Using splice :

   ```js
   a.splice(0, a.length());
   ```

   The `splice()` method removed all the elements of the array and returned the removed element as an array

3. Setting the length to zero :

   ```js
   a.length = 0;
   ```

4. Using pop() method :

   ```js
   while (a.length > 0) {
     a.pop();
   }
   ```

   This is relatively straightforward, but may not be the most performant solution among the other methods.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 4. What is the difference between console.log, alert() and document.write()

`console.log` is mainly used to debug the code.

Syntax : `console.log("Hello world")`

&nbsp;

`alert()` method displays an alert box over the current window with specified message.

Syntax : `alert("Hello World")`

&nbsp;

`document.write()` is used when you want to print the content to the HTML document.

Syntax : `document.write("Hello world)`

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 5. What is Node?

Node is a CPP programming language where we can add js functionalities.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 6. Is JS a Client-Side or Server-Side Language?

Client-side

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 7. Why do we avoid to use var?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
