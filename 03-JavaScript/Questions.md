# Answer

# Introduction

## 1. What is Programming

Programming is the way of talking to computer

&nbsp;

## 2. What does ES stand for

ES stands for EcmaScript

&nbsp;

## 3. What is ECMAScript

Ecmascript defines the specification of scripting language.
Ecmascript is the specification or standard that tells how scripting language should be.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 5. How is it related to JavaScript

- JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript.

- ECMAScript provides the core features (such as data types, objects, functions, and control structures), while JavaScript adds browser-specific functionalities like DOM manipulation, events, and APIs.

- Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint, and JavaScript as a practical implementation based on that blueprint.

# Datatype

## 2. Is null an independent type or object

```md
null is an object type
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

# Variable

### 8. Can we declare Many Variables is one statement

```md
Yes. By using comma.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Closure

### 1. What is a closure in JavaScript?

```md
A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer function's variables and parameters.

It allows the inner function to access and manipulate the outer function's variables, even after the outer function has returned.
```

&nbsp;

### 2. Why are closures important in JavaScript?

```md
Closures are important in JavaScript because they allow for information hiding and encapsulation. They also allow for private variables and methods, which can be useful in certain scenarios.
```

&nbsp;

### 3. Can you give an example of a closure in JavaScript?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 1. What are the Difference Between String `indexOf()` and String `search()`

```md
The `indexOf()` method cannot search against a regular expression.

The `search()` cannot take a start position argument.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 2.Why do we use functions?

```md
With functions you can reuse code

You can write code that can be used many times.

You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 3. What are the ways to empty an array?

1. Assigning to it in a new empty array :

   ```js
   let a = [1, 2, 3];
   console.log(b); // [1,2,3]

   let b = [];
   b = a;
   console.log(b); // []
   ```

   when the value `a` is assigned to an empty array `b`, the array `a` will also be empty. This is the fastest way to empty an aray.

2. Using splice :

   ```js
   a.splice(0, a.length());
   ```

   The `splice()` method removed all the elements of the array and returned the removed element as an array

3. Setting the length to zero :

   ```js
   a.length = 0;
   ```

4. Using pop() method :

   ```js
   while (a.length > 0) {
     a.pop();
   }
   ```

   This is relatively straightforward, but may not be the most performant solution among the other methods.

&nbsp;

# 4. What is the difference between console.log, alert() and document.write()

`console.log` is mainly used to debug the code.

Syntax : `console.log("Hello world")`

&nbsp;

`alert()` method displays an alert box over the current window with specified message.

Syntax : `alert("Hello World")`

&nbsp;

`document.write()` is used when you want to print the content to the HTML document.

Syntax : `document.write("Hello world)`

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 5. What is Node?

Node is a CPP programming language where we can add js functionalities.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 6. Is JS a Client-Side or Server-Side Language?

Client-side

&nbsp;

# 7. Why do we avoid to use var?
