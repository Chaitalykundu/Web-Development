# Commit

Since we have finished our work, we are ready move from `stage` to `commit` for our repo.

Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work.

Git considers each commit **_change point or "save point"_**. It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.

By adding clear messages to each commit, it is easy for yourself (and others) to see what has changed and when.

## Note

**When we commit, we should always include a message.**
