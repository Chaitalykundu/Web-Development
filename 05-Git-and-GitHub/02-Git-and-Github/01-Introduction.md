# What is Git

- Git is a Distributed Version Control System
- It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
- It is a free and open source tool
- It can be used within the DevOps workflows to maintain good version control.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Use of Git

It is used for:

- Tracking code changes
- Tracking who made changes
- Coding collaboration

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# What does Git do

- Manage projects with Repositories
- **Clone** a project to work on a local copy
- Control and track changes with **Staging** and **Committing**
- **Branch and Merge** to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
- **Pull** the latest version of the project to a local copy
- **Push** local updates to the main project

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Why Git

- Developers can work together from anywhere in the world
- Developers can see the full history of a project
- Developers can revert to earlier version of a project

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Features of Git

- If any file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered as modified

- Git allows to track the full history of every commit

- We can evert back in every version of previous commit

- We select the modified files we want to stage

- Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit. but keeps the track of changes of made in each commit

- The staged files are committed , which prompts git to store a permanent snapshot of the files

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Working with Git

- Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository

- Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder

- When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified

- You select the modified files you want to Stage

- The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files

- Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.

- You can revert back to any previous commit.

- Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
