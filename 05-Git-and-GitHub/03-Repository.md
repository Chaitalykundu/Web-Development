# Repository

A repository is a collection of files and directories that are stored together.

It is a way to store and manage the code.

It is like a folder of a computer.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Git Repository

A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Initializing a new repository: `git init`

To create a new repo, you'll use the following command.

```bash
git init
```

&nbsp;

`git init` is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo.

Executing this command Git will create a hidden folder `.git` in your current working directory to keep track of changes.

This will also create a **new main branch**.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Create a directory / folder

```bash
 mkdir "FOLDER-NAME"
```

&nbsp;

```bash
cd "FOLDER-NAME"
```

&nbsp;

`mkdir` **makes** a new directory.

`cd` **changes** the **current working directory**.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Check lists of directory / files

```bash
ls
```

`ls` will **list** the files in the directory

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Check lists of all directory / files (also hidden)

```bash
ls -la
```
