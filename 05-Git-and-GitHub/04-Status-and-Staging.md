# Git Status

We can check the **status** of any file using the following command

### full status

```bash
 git status
```

&nbsp;

### Short status

```bash
 git status -s
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# States of files

Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:

- **Untracked** - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository

- **Tracked** - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to **stage** them, or **add** them to the staging environment.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Git Staging Environment

As we are working, we may be adding, editing and removing files. But whenever we hit a milestone or finish a part of the work, we should add the files to a Staging Environment.

**_Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository we are working on._**

&nbsp;

### To stage **any particular file**, we use the following command

```bash
git add FILENAME
```

&nbsp;

### To stage **more than one file**, we use the following command

```bash
git add FILENAME1, FILENAME2, FILENAME3
```

&nbsp;

### To stage **all changed files**, we use the following command

```bash
git add .
```

or

```bash
git add --all
```

or

```bash
git add -a
```
