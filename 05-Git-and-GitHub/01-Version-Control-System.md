# VCS

VCS = Version Control System

&nbsp;

**_Version Control System_** is a category of software tools that records the changes of a file or set of files so that you can recall the specific version later.

&nbsp;

Basically VCS keeps track on changes made on a particular software and take a snapshot of every modification along with the information like who made and what changes have been made.

Let’s suppose if a team of developer add some new functionalities in an application and the updated version is not working properly so as the version control system keeps track of our work so with the help of version control system we can omit the new changes and continue with the previous version.

&nbsp;

A separate branch is created for every contributor who made the changes and the changes aren’t merged into the original source code unless all are analyzed as soon as the changes are green signaled they merged to the main source code.
