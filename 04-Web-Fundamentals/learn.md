# Terminology

- NETWORK : A network is a connected group of devices (computers, servers, etc.) that can share resources and communicate with each other.

- INTERNET (Global network): The internet is a Service connecting computers and devices, enabling communication, information exchange, and online services.

- IP address : An IP address is a numerical label (unique identifier) assigned to each device connected to a computer network for identification and communication.

- BROWSER ( Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Opera, Brave ) : A browser serves as the interface between a user and the World Wide Web (WWW) by interacting with web servers to retrieve and display web pages.

- SERVER : A server is like a powerful computer that helps other devices by providing services or resources, such as hosting websites or storing files.

- DOMAIN NAME : A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify and access websites. The domain name and IP address are not the same, they are related but serve different
  purposes.

- IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) : It uses a 32-bit address scheme. The addresses are typically expressed as four sets of numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.0.1).

- IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) : It uses a 128-bit address scheme, providing a vastly larger number of unique addresses compared to IPv4. IPv6 addresses are often represented as a series of hexadecimal characters separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

- IPv6 was introduced to address the limitation of available addresses in IPv4, ensuring the continued growth of the internet and the increasing number of connected devices.
