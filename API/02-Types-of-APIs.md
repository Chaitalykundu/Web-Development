# Types of APIs

## Based on Medium

There are **three** types of APIs based on medium

- <u>**_Hardware APIs_**</u> :

  - Interface for software to talk to hardware.
  - Example: How your phone's camera talks to the operating system.

- <u>**_Software Library APIs_**</u> :

  - Interface for directly consuming code from another code base.
  - Example: Using methods from a library you import into your application.

- <u>**_Web APIs_**</u> :

  - Interface for communicating across code bases over a network.
  - Example: Fetching current stock prices from a finance API over the internet.

## Based on Architecture

There is more than one way to build and consume APIs.
Some architecture types are:

- REST (Representational State Transfer)
- GraphQL
- WebSockets
- webhooks
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
- MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport)

&nbsp;

## Based on Access

APIs also vary in the scope of who can access them.

- <u>**_Public APIs (aka Open APIs)_**</u> : Consumed by anyone who discovers the API

- <u>**_Private APIs_**</u> : Consumed only within an organization and not made public

- <u>**_Partner APIs_**</u> : Consumed between one or more organizations that have an established relationship
