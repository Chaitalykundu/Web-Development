Components define areas of responsibility in the UI that let you reuse sets of UI functionality.

A component consists of three things:

| Component Part            | Details                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| A component class         | Handles data and functionality |
| An HTML template          | Determines the UI              |
| Component-specific styles | Define the look and feel       |
