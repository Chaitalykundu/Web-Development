- **_<u>Angular CLI_**</u>: The Command Line Interface (CLI) automates processes like app initialization and configuration with quick commands.

- **_<u>Testing_**</u>: Testing is a standard feature in Angular, and all JavaScript code is subjected to a set of tests.

- **_<u>Standalone components_**</u>: Reusable components that can be added or removed easily.

- **_<u>Angular Universal_**</u>: Uses platforms like Node.js to introduce server-side rendering capabilities to Angular applications.

# AngularJS Extends HTML

AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.

- The **ng-app** directive defines an AngularJS application.

- The **ng-model** directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

- The **ng-bind** directive binds application data to the HTML view.

# Angular CLI

The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shell.

# Framework vs Libraries

### Frameworks

- Frameworks generally contains a set of libraries
- You can extend the frameworks
- Example : Angular, .net, Ionic, ExpressJS

&nbsp;

### Libraries

- Libraries generally perform specific operations
- We can combine multiple libraries to build apps
- Example : React, MomentJS, Lodash
