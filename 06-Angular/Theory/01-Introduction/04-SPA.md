# What is SPA

SPA = Single Page Application

A single-page application (SPA) is a web app that loads a single page and then dynamically updates the content based on user interactions.

SPAs are designed to feel more like native apps, with faster transitions and a more responsive experience.

SPA does not make requests to server for every URL request

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# How SPA work

SPAs use HTML5 and Ajax to load all the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code on the initial load, or to dynamically load resources as needed. This means that the page doesn't need to reload completely, and instead only the relevant content is updated.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# How to build SPA

SPAs are built using frontend frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Ember.js, Meteor.js, or Knockout.js.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# How Angular helps in SPA

Angular has routing functionality to create SPA

Angular also offers SSR (Server Side Rendering) which supports SPA

&nbsp;

2. SPA is fast, as most resources (HTML+CSS+Scripts) are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of application.

3. Gmail, Facebook are some examples of SPA.
