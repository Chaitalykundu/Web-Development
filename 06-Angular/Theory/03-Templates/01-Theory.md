# Understanding templates

In Angular, a template is a blueprint for a fragment of a user interface (UI).

Templates are written in **HTML**, and special syntax can be used within a template to build on many of Angular's features.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Each Angular template in your application is a section of HTML to include as a part of the page that the browser displays. An Angular HTML template renders a view, or user interface, in the browser, just like regular HTML, but with a lot more functionality.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When you generate an Angular application with the Angular CLI, the `app.component.html` file is the default template containing placeholder HTML.

The template syntax guides show you how to control the UX/UI by coordinating data between the class and the template.

# Empower your HTML

Extend the HTML vocabulary of your applications with special Angular syntax in your templates. For example, Angular helps you get and set DOM (Document Object Model) values dynamically with features such as built-in template functions, variables, event listening, and data binding.

&nbsp;

an Angular template is part of an overall webpage, and not the entire page, you don't need to include elements such as `<html>`, `<body>`, or `<base>`, and can focus exclusively on the part of the page you are developing.
