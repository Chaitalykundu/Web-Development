## Round 1

1. Check If The String Is A Palindrome

   ```md
   You are given a string 'S'. Your task is to check whether the string is palindrome or not. For checking palindrome, consider alphabets and numbers only and ignore the symbols and whitespaces.
   ```

   Explanation :-

   - Step1: To solve a memoization problem, we need to use the closure.

   - Step2: The inner function remembers the data in the variable which is declared in the scope of outer function.

   - Step3: Write the logic for caching the data for 2 cases.One for calling a callback function & storing the result in the outer variable & other case for accessing the stored data in that variable.

2. Missing Number

   ```md
   You are given an array/list ‘BINARYNUMS’ that consists of ‘N’ distinct strings which represent all integers from 0 to N in binary representation except one integer. This integer between 0 to ‘N’ whose binary representation is not present in list ‘BINARYNUMS’ is called ‘Missing Integer’.

   Your task is to find the binary representation of that ‘Missing Integer’. You should return a string that represents this ‘Missing Integer’ in binary without leading zeros.
   ```

Note :

1. There will be no leading zeros in any string in the list ‘BINARYNUMS’.

## Round 2

1. Maximum Product Subarray

   ```md
   You are given an array “arr'' of integers. Your task is to find the contiguous subarray within the array which has the largest product of its elements. You have to report this maximum product.
   ```
