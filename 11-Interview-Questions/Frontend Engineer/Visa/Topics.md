# Coding

## Round 1

1. Javascript Program

   ```md
   Write a JS program to implement memoization using closures.
   ```

   Explanation :-

   - Step1: To solve a memoization problem, we need to use the closure.

   - Step2: The inner function remembers the data in the variable which is declared in the scope of outer function.

   - Step3: Write the logic for caching the data for 2 cases.One for calling a callback function & storing the result in the outer variable & other case for accessing the stored data in that variable.

2. Javascript Program

   ```md
   Write a program to implement polyfill for map function in javascript.
   ```

   Explanation :-

   - Step1: Write a check whether that function is available already or not?

   - Step2: Once above step is done, then write logic to loop over the array on which map is supposed to be applied & call the callback function to get the result & return it.

   - Step3: Make sure you handle logic using "this" properly.

## Round 2

3. Javascript Program

   ```md
   Write a program to implement throttling & debouncing in JS?
   ```

   Approach :-

   - Step1: Write a utility function to handle throttling logic. we can leverage a closure concept here.
   - Step2: Add a flag variable in outer function scope & make it by default true.

   - Step3: In the inner function, place a if check & write logic to call the callback function & make flag as false.

   - Step4: Turn the flag as true after the timeout period.

   - Step5: Repeat similar logic for debouncing but slightly alter it instead of flag & replace with timer.
