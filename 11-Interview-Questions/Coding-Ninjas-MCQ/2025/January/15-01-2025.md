# Description

1. The document.getElementById() method is used to retrieve an HTML element based on its unique ID attribute.

2. Passport-JWT does not store the User object in request headers. Instead, it uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate requests, which contain a token string that can be used to verify the user's identity. The token is usually included in the Authorization header, while the User object is typically retrieved from the token on the server side.
