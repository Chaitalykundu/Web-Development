# Description

1. Yes, JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it can execute only one task at a time in a single call stack. However, it uses asynchronous operations like callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle multiple tasks efficiently without blocking the main thread.

2. It is called just before unmounting the component and therefore any cleanup is done in this method

3. The "width" property gets overridden by "flex-basis" property. So, "flex-basis: 250px;" gets applied and the width of the element becomes "250px".
