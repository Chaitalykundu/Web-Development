# Description

1. The statement ‘ new Abc(); ’ will make a new object of ‘Abc’ and call the constructor of ‘Abc’, then in the constructor the statement ‘ return {a: 35, b: 44}; ’will return a new object which would get stored in var obj. Thus on printing obj.a and obj.b will print 35 and 44.

2. The statement ‘let person1 = new People('John', 21);’ will create a new People object and call it’s constructor function. Which assigns value of person and age to the object and define the function info. The statement ‘person1.info();’ will invoke the function info of the person1 object. In function info ‘console.log(this); ’ this keyword refers to an object, that object which is executing the current bit of javascript code. After 3000ms setTieout() will print John is 21 years old.
