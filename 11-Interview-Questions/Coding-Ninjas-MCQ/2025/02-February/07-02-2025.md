# Description

1. The parseInt() function in JavaScript converts a string into an integer. It takes a string as a parameter and returns the corresponding number.

2. By default, the useCapture parameter is false, meaning the listener is attached to the bubbling phase, where events propagate from the target to the top of the DOM tree.

3. Since it's an unordered list, we use the `<ul>` tag; for the filled circle we can set the type attribute of the `<ul>` tag as a disc.

4. The callback is an asynchronous equivalent for a function.
