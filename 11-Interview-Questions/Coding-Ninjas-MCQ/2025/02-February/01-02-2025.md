# Description

1. The CSS property used to control the scrolling behavior of a background image is `background-attachment`. It allows you to specify whether the background image should scroll with the content, remain fixed in place, or scroll independently. The possible values for background-attachment are: ->scroll: The background image will scroll with the content as the user scrolls the page. ->fixed: The background image will remain fixed in place, and it won't scroll with the content. ->local: The background image will scroll with the element's content if the element has its own scrolling (e.g., an element with overflow: auto). ->initial: It sets the property to its default value.

2. This method is called before updating a component and if it returns false it does not update the component.
