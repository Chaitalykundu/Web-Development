1.  Suppose there is a class 'Person' and an object 'person' is created as follows -

    ```js

     class Person = {
     constructor(name) { this.name = name; }
     <!-- …… Other methods ….. -->
     }
     var person = new Person("James");
    ```

The below statement returns true or false if a property is present in the person object -

```js
person.hasOwnProperty(property);
```

Where does this function in JavaScript come from?
