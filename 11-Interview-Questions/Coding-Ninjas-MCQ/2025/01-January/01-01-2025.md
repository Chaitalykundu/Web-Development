# Description

1. in setTimeout, if the time interval is not defined then it will just wait for other tasks to finish and then it will execute the setTimeout function.

2. The property that does not count in the total width of an element on a web page is the
   margin. Margin is the spacing outside the element, and it does not contribute to the element's total width. The border and padding properties are part of the element's total width. However, the margin does not contribute to the element's total width but rather creates space around the element.

3. The "width" property gets overridden by "flex-basis" property. So, "flex-basis: 250px;" gets applied and the width of the element becomes "250px".

4. The super keyword is used to call base/parent class functions from child class functions in JavaScript.
