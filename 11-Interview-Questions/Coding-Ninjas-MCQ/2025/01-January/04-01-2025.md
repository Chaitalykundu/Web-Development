# Answer

1. True

2. People {person: "John", age: 21, info: ƒ} John is 21 years old

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Description

1. The method " valueOf()" returns the value of the parameter that was passed in it.

2. The statement ‘let person1 = new People('John', 21);’ will create a new People object and call it’s constructor function. Which assigns value of person and age to the object and define the function info. The statement ‘person1.info();’ will invoke the function info of the person1 object. In function info ‘console.log(this); ’ this keyword refers to an object, that object which is executing the current bit of javascript code. After 3000ms setTieout() will print John is 21 years old.
