# Description

1. The super keyword is used to call base/parent class functions from child class functions in JavaScript.

2. setTimeout() returns a timeoutID which is a positive integer value which identifies the timer created by the call to setTimeout(). We can say that timeoutID is a unique identifier which can be passed to the clearTimeout() to cancel the timeout.
