4. color

5. Statement 1 is false because null is treated as an absence of value by the ‘==’ operator. Statement 2 is true because null is converted to 0 by the ‘>’ operator, so 0 is equal to 0.

# Description

1. There is no default value of border-style. One needs to mention the style on their own else border will not show

2. Since it's an unordered list, we use the `<ul>` tag; for the filled circle we can set the type attribute of the `<ul>` tag as a disc.

3. When we use `__blank` for the target, the document opens in the new tab.

4. "**color**" property is used to change the text color of an element.

5. This is a peculiarity of Js. The operators ‘>’ and ‘<’ convert the ‘null’ to numerical 0 while the ‘==’ will treat it as an absence of value.
