# Description

1. Passport-JWT does not store the User object in request headers. Instead, it uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate requests, which contain a token string that can be used to verify the user's identity. The token is usually included in the Authorization header, while the User object is typically retrieved from the token on the server side.

2. Actions only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes. Reducer specifies how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
