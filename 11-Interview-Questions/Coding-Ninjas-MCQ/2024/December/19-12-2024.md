# Description

The replace() removes the current document from the browsing history before loading the new document.The difference between assign method and replace(), is that replace() removes the URL of the current document from the document history, meaning that it is not possible to use the “back” button to navigate back to the original document. For example, in console type window.location.replace("<https://www.wikipedia.org>");
