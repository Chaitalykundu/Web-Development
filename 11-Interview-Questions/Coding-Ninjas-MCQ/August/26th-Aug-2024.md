# Questions

1. What does JWT stands for?

2. Choose the correct statement/s.

   ```js
   const foo = new Promise((res, rej) => {
     res(1);
   });

   async function faa() {
     return foo;
   }

   function res() {
     return Promise.resolve(foo);
   }

   console.log(foo === faa()); //statement 1
   console.log(foo === res()); //statement 2
   ```

   ```md
   a. Statement 1 and statement 2, both are true because all the three functions foo(), faa() and res(), will be referencing the same function.

   b. Statement 1 is false, because the faa() function will be referencing a new promise and Statement 2 will be true because the foo() will be referencing the same promise as the res() function.

   c. Statement 1 and statement 2, both are false because all the three functions foo(), faa() and res(), will be referencing different functions.

   d. Statement 1 is true, because the faa() function will be referencing the same promise and Statement 2 will be false because the foo() will be referencing a new promise as the res() function.
   ```

3. Which of the following is used to change the HTML content?

4. What is the expected output?

   ```js
   var student = {
     firstName: "jonathan",
     lastName: "doe",
   };

   delete student.firstName;
   console.log(student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
   ```

2. Statement 1 is false, because the faa() function will be referencing a new promise and Statement 2 will be true because the foo() will be referencing the same promise as the res() function.

3. innerHTML

4. undefined doe

5. undefinedb

# Description

1. JWT stands for "JSON Web Token." It is a compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

2. The foo() function will output a Promise resolved with value 1 as output. The faa() function will wrap the output of the foo() function into a Promise.resolve and it will return a different reference promise.So, faa() === foo is false. You should know that Async functions always return a promise. If the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The function res() will return a promise value referencing the same foo() promise. So, res() === foo() is true.

3. To change the HTML content, use the innerHTML property in JavaScript.
