# Description

1. In CSS, the "a" in rgba stands for "alpha," which defines the opacity level of the color. It ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque).

2. Const keyword fixes the value of the variable. Const keyword can not be redefined. Therefore attempts to alter the value or re-declaration causes errors.

3. The map() method creates a new array by applying a function to every element in the original array.
