# Description

1.

2. The map() method creates a new array by applying a function to every element in the original array.

3. Explanation: The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects. In the HTML DOM (Document Object Model), everything is a node: The document itself is a document node. All HTML elements are element nodes. All HTML attributes are attribute nodes. Text inside HTML elements are text nodes. Comments are comment nodes.

4. Passport-JWT does not store the User object in request headers. Instead, it uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate requests, which contain a token string that can be used to verify the user's identity. The token is usually included in the Authorization header, while the User object is typically retrieved from the token on the server side.
