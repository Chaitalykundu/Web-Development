# Description

1. JavaScript uses lexical scoping, meaning the scope of variables is determined by their location within the source code, and nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scopes.

2. The statement new A() will make a new object of ‘A’ and call the constructor of object ‘A’, which will return var obj. Similarly the statement new B() will make a new object of ‘B’ and call the constructor of object ‘B’, which will return var obj. Hence console.log( new A() == new B() ); will print true in the console.
