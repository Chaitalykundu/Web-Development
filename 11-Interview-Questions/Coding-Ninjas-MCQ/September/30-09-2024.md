# Description

1. HTML comments are enclosed within `< !--` and `-->`. These comments are not displayed in the browser and are used for adding notes or explanations within the code.

2. using the break statement loop breaks at temp = 3

3. This is a peculiarity of Js. The operators ‘>’ and ‘<’ convert the ‘null’ to numerical 0 while the ‘==’ will treat it as an absence of value.

4. The correct place to refer to the external style sheet in an HTML document is inside the head section. The head section locates at the topmost part of the HTML document, and it's where you add the external style sheet code to access the CSS file from which you can use it to apply the stylings to an HTML web page.

5. Some HTML elements don’t require a closing tag, for them the opening tag itself is a self-closing tag.
