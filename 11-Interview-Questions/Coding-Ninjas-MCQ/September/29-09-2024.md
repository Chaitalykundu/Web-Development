# Description

1. The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks in HTML, which allows users to navigate between different pages or sections.

2. The line-height property controls the amount of space between lines of text.

3. You need to use a variable when creating the interval method to use the 'clearInterval' method. Eg., var myVar = setInterval(JSfunction, timeInMilliseconds); clearInterval(myVar);

4. Yes, JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it can execute only one task at a time in a single call stack. However, it uses asynchronous operations like callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle multiple tasks efficiently without blocking the main thread.
