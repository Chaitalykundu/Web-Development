3. Hint : Self Invoking Functions are used Explanation: The function that IIFE is returning contains the lexical context of the IIFE, and it's stored in ‘add’. It gets invoked 3 times, and each time the counter is updated in the same lexical context.

4. `.then()` can be used to access the data returned by the promise object.

5. When we use `__blank` for the target, the document opens in the new tab.
