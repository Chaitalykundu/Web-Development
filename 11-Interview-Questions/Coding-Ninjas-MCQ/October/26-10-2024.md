# Description

1. - Margin is the spacing outside the element, and it does not contribute to the element's total width.

   - The border and padding properties are part of the element's total width. However, the margin does not contribute to the element's total width but rather creates space around the element.

2. Event propagation is the process by which the browser decides which objects to trigger event handlers. Event propagation is a way to describe the “stack” of events that are fired in a web browser.
