# Sprint

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.

Sprint is the part of Scrum, not agile or kanban.

Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies, and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.

# Sprint planning

Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint.

The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved.

Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.
