- If we want to target any class / element, we can check simply just by changing background color

# Selector : Pseudo ELements

Suppose we have created a large website. Suddenly we need to make some changes like **_we need to add some texts after each paragraph._** That time we can use `::after`

# Flex

- Default behaviour of flex is **left to right**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Display

- All **li** is block level element. So to make them horizontally aligned it's good practice to use **display : inline**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Position

- Suppose we have two elements A & B. If we want to make A's position absolute with respect to B, then we have to set `position : relative` to element B first and then set `position:absolute` to element A.
