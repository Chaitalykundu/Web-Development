# Problem statement

Optimizing the Usability and Functionality of a Web-Based Counter Application.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Must to have

- The id of the Increase should be "increase".
- The id of the Decrease should be "decrease".
- The id of the Reset should be "reset".

&nbsp;

## Functionality tested

- Increase button should increase the counter by 1 everytime.

- Decrease button should decrease the counter by 1 everytime.

- Decrease button should stop working when counter reaches to zero.

- Reset button should reset the counter to '0' ( Use addEventListener for this instead of the function or onclick).
