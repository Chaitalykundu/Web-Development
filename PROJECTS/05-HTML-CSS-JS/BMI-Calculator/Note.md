# Problem statement

Celsius To Fahrenheit

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Must to have

- Ensure that the `< title>` tag consist of 'Temperature Converter'

- Within the 'container', you should have the following elements:

- An `< h1>` element that contains the content 'Temperature Converter'.

- An `< input>` element with the correct attributes:

- id set to 'celsius'. - type set to 'number' , placeholder as 'Enter Celsius temperature' and step as 1.

- A < button> element with the content 'Convert'. This button should trigger the 'convertTemperature' function when clicked. Conversion of the temperature in this function is not necessary in this problem just make sure the the function can be triggered through the button

- A `< p>` element with the class 'result' and an id of 'result'. This element should be initially empty.

- Set the background color of the webpage to **rgb(243, 243, 243)**.

- Adjust the background color of the container to **rgb(255, 255, 255)**.

- Apply a padding of **20px** to the container.

- Set the border radius of the container to **10px**.

- Change the color of `< h1>` elements to **rgb(52, 152, 219)**.

- Ensure that `< input>` elements span the entire width of their container.

- Apply a padding of 8px to `< input>` elements.

- Add a bottom margin of 10px to `< input>` elements.

- Set the background color of `< button>` elements to rgb(52, 152, 219).

- Adjust the text color of `< button>` elements to rgb(255, 255, 255).

- Apply a border radius of 5px to `< button>` elements.

- Set the cursor to a pointer for `< button>` elements.

- On hover, change the background color of `< button>` elements to red.

- A function named convertTemperature.

## Functionality tested

- In the convertTemperature function you need the covert the celcius into fahrenheit

- The celcius should be entered in the input , and the output shall appear in < p> with "Fahrenheit: " showing before the numeric.

- The formula for convertion is fahrenheit = (celsius \* 9/5) + 32 , the solution should round to 2 decimal places .
