# title

- The `title` is one of several elements that provide extra information not visible on the web page, but it is useful for search engines or how the page gets displayed.

&nbsp;

# meta

- meta element with an attribute named charset set to the value utf-8 to tell the browser how to encode characters for the page

* meta elements are self-closing.

* For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.

&nbsp;

# main

- It will eventually contain pricing information about coffee and desserts offered by the cafe.

&nbsp;

# section

- There will be two sections on the menu, one for coffees and one for desserts.

* Add a section element within the main element so you have a place to put all the coffees available.

  &nbsp;

# div

- The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far.

&nbsp;

# article

- article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor.

&nbsp;

# same line

- The p elements are nested in an article element with the class attribute of item. So we need to put `display:inline-block;` in `p` of item class

* the price didn't stay over on the right. This is because `inline-block` elements only take up the width of their content. To spread them out, add a `width` property to the flavor and `price` class selectors that have a value of `50%` each.

&nbsp;

# font-family

- You can add a fallback value for the font-family by adding another font name separated by a comma. Fallbacks are used in instances where the initial is not found/available.
